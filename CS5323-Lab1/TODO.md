#  TODO

Automatic Layout 
Buttons, Sliders, and Labels
Stepper and Switch
Picker (you must implement picker delegate)
Segmented Control
Timer (which should repeat and somehow update the UIView)
ScrollView (with scrollable, zoomable content)
Image View
Navigation Controller
Collection View Controller
Table View Controller with three different dynamic prototype cells
The design should work in both portrait and landscape mode
I should not be able to crash your app
Your design must strictly adhere to Model View Controller programming practices
Use lazy instantiation when possible
